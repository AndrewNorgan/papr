# About

This is the __papr__ app. Think of it as "[Tinder](https://www.gotinder.com/) for pre-prints". If you don't know what Tinder is, think of it as a web app for collecting gut-reactions to pre-prints from the scientific community. For the moment the app only displays papers on [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/), but if there is demand we may consider adding other pre-print servers as well.

# Your data and research

The ratings you submit through this app are not associated in any way with any information about you. The data may be used in aggregate to improve the functionality of the app or to research community ratings of pre-prints.

# Author

It was built by [Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/) as an example of the sort of thing we hope to build with the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab. If you want a web or mobile app prototyped, consider submitting an app idea for free prototyping at our [Prototyping Shop](http://jhudatascience.org/prototyping/).

[Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](http://lucymcgowan.com) and [Nick Strayer](http://nickstrayer.me), [Vanderbilt Biostatistics](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/biostatistics/graduate/) PhD students, added swipe functionality.

# Terms

This app is provided solely for entertainment of the scientific community and may be taken down at any time with no notice because Jeff gets tired of it. It is provided "as is" and is not guaranteed to do anything really. Use at your own risk and hopefully enjoy :).
