### How do I use papr? 

<hr>

Look at the paper on the right hand side. Rate it by swiping in the direction indicated on the left hand side. If you want, download your ratings. 

#### What are my rating choices?

For each paper we are considering two questions with two possible answers. 

* _Is the paper interesting?_ - a paper can be rated as exciting or boring. We leave the definitions of those terms up to you. 
* _Is the paper correct or questionable?_ - a paper can either be solidly correct or potentially questionable in its results. We leave the definitions of those terms up to you. 

#### I think its stupid to rate papers on this scale

The creator is an editor of a [journal](biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org) and the author of a [guide to reviewing](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews). He's interested in what he finds out with this app but doesn't pretend that this is a substitute for peer review, or anything really. Its just for fun. 

#### Why does it keep showing me different papers?

__papr__ shows you one paper at random from the current list of [bioRxiv](http://biorxiv.org/) papers. You rate it, then it picks another one at random to show you. We will use this information to perform research on community sentiments about published preprints.
